        Steven Zhu, known mononymously as Zhu (/zuÀê/; stylized in all caps;[3] born April 28, 1989), is an American electronic music producer and singer who has been active since the beginning of 2014, signed to Mind of a Genius Records.[4] Until mid-2014, Zhu remained anonymous, asking to be judged by his music alone. His debut album, Generationwhy, was released on July 29, 2016[5] and first premiered at Coachella during his closing set in the Sahara Tent. Zhu's Coachella performance was praised, with a writer for the New York Observer suggesting that he could be "the next Daft Punk".[6]
