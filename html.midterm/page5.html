Page1.html Corrections

1) Missing correct format at the top of the page:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
    
2) Missing a closing tag </div> for the first div element
3) The <e> closing tag for <em> is misspelled. It should be </em>.
4) The <head> element doesn't include meta information
5) Missing an </html> closing tag

  
Page2.html Corrections
  
1) The closing tag <b> is missing in the first paragraph.
2) In the second paragraph, the link in the first sentence is broken because it's missing the "http://" protocol.
3) In the fourth paragraph, the link in the last sentence is missing a destination.
4) In the last paragraph of the first section, the <b> tag is used to make the text bold, but it is used incorrectly as the closing tag is missing.
5) In the last paragraph, the closing tag for the <p> tag is missing.

The <hr> tag is used multiple times to create a visual separator between sections, but it might be better to use a <section> tag with a bottom margin.
The use of <span> with a pipe character to separate the navigation links could be better achieved using a <nav> tag or by using an unordered list with the list items set to display as inline-block elements.
The <a> tag in the first paragraph could have a better link text that accurately describes the target page.


Page3.html Corrections
  
The HTML code creates a simple web page with the title "Page 3". The page contains a navigation bar at the top with links to different pages and a heading with a source link to a Wikipedia page about tables. There is also text that provides a basic description of what a table is and its basic structure. 
The code also contains an example table with header rows and rows that have inconsistent number of cells.

There are some errors in the code:

In the third bullet point of the unordered list, the <l> tag should be <li>
In the second row of the table, the last cell contains an invalid tag <> which should be removed or changed to a valid tag such as <td>.
In the last row of the table, the <td> tag should be inside a <tr> tag.
  
  
Page4.html Corrections
  
This is an HTML code for a web page with four pages linked in a navigation bar, a table displaying images in three columns (Dogs, Cats, and Other?) and six rows. Each cell of the table contains an image represented by the img tag with a source attribute pointing to the relative path of the image file. 
The style section in the head defines the default width and height of the images to be 200 pixels.
