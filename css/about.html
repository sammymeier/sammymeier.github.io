<h2>About me</h2>
<div id="fullBio"><p>
    I am a 4th year student at the University of Boulder Colorado. I grew up in the Bay Area with three older siblings. 
    In my free time I like to ski and hangout with friends. Currently, I am looking for a job after graduation and would love to live in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Central-Park-New-York-City">New York.</a>. 
    Feel free to look at my website and learn a little more about who I am and the work I've done so far.</p>
